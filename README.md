XT Keyboard Project:

This repo is for all the files used in designing and manufacturing a mechanical keyboard that I made from scratch
The keyboard itself is a modified XT layout, which was a very popular layout for 1980's keyboards.

The case is inspired by the IBM Model F77, Cherry G80-0418 and the modern NCR80.
Later angularity and side-bezel thickness was inspired by the Pravetz 16 from the Soviet Union and various NCR G80 varieties, for example the NCR G80-0478.

The pcb is hotswap with stepped caps lock, split left- and right shift, and split backspace compatibility.
In addition, it is QMK compatible, due to the ATMega32u4 microchip. Further VIA compatibility to be added.
